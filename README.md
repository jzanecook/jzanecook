  Welcome to my profile! I'm Ziggy, a self-taught software developer based in South Texas. My programming journey began with C++ and QBasic, but I truly embraced the power of coding with JavaScript, Python, and Rust. I've recently embarked on a new venture, founding Z90 Studios, with a mission to create cutting-edge products and achieve financial independence.

Let's connect and explore the exciting world of programming, innovation, and AI together!
